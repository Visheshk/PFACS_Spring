### 1:   Development tool
* React (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* Semantic UI React (https://react.semantic-ui.com)
* Styled Component (https://www.styled-components.com)
* React Router (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)

React is a UI Framework allowed for a component based development. It also allows for reusing different component. It needs a little bit learning curve, but it will help improve the code readability and management. It is a data driven framework to work

Typescript is an improved version of Javascript to ensure a good standard of the code in development cycle. It is a static typed language, like Java. You can still write any code in Javascript as long as I close the lint. 

Semantic UI React similar to bootstrap is the UI styling framework I used to quickly create a ok looking website

Styled Component is small, simple library that allows the person to embed the styling sheet in each componenet. It saves the need to create a bunch of stylesheet in the code

### 2:   How to run

To install all of the dependency:
type:  ``` npm install ``` 

Then run the frontend server:
type: ```npm run```

Now, you are good to go by opening the browser. 

It only runs the frontend, so if you want to make it actually usable, run the backend. It connects the frontend and the backend with web service.
